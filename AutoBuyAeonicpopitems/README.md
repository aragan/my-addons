I created this add-on a long time ago. It was code, and I developed it further. I have several versions, and I've released the simplest one now. I'm releasing it because I don't need it anymore, and I want people to benefit from it. No one knew about it except those who played with me, and no one would know about it if I hadn't released it now. So I started wondering what developers have been working on all these years. Is it because no one thought of this? Because I searched for anything similar and found absolutely nothing. I know there are developers who could do it, but I don't know what's stopping them. It helped me and made many purchases easier when I was the leader of LinkShell and we were working on the Clear Aeonic weapon. I could buy everything with a single click. It's precious to me, and I never thought of releasing it; it was meant to remain a secret forever.



I’m not just releasing another addon – I’m releasing a flame that has been hidden in the depths of the game for years.
This addon was born in the heart of the fire, back in the days when I was leading a linkshell and dealing with an ocean of trades, pops, and preparations for endless Aeonic runs. In the middle of that wave, I built a ship for myself: a addon that turns a single command into a chain of actions, quietly executing dozens of steps in the background that other people were still drowning in manually.

While others were counting every trade, every purchase, every little step, I was crossing that sea with a silent fire no one could see – cutting through the time and chaos with a single press. This addon was never “just code” to me. It was a leadership weapon, a hidden advantage, a line separating the one who leads from the one who gets buried under the details.

For many years, this tool stayed a secret between me and the people who played with me. I searched a lot to see if anyone had built something similar – anyone who had tried to turn all this work into one click – and I found nothing. Not because developers couldn’t do it, but because the fire only really lights up in the heart of someone who has actually been burned by the experience. If you’ve never drowned in the sea of Aeonic organization, pops, and logistics, you’ll never truly feel the need for a monster of automation like this one.

I always thought this addon would stay in the depths, buried with me as a permanent secret. But what’s the point of a flame that never lights the way for anyone else? And what’s the value of a tool that carried me across that ocean if it never opens a path for the ones who come after?

So I’m releasing it now.
I’m releasing something that was once my personal edge, my hidden weapon, a quiet pillar of how I led and organized. I’m putting it in the hands of every leader, every player who carries the weight of coordination, everyone who is tired of repeating the same buys and trades as if they’re chained to endless macros.


If this addon helped me cross a whole sea of Aeonic work and grinding, maybe it can be the fire that lights your way, too.
